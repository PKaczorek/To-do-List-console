# To-do-List-console
Updated Basic To-do list in console
Starts with Menu in which we have all available commands, such as:
-list ( Command which shows all available tasks we have in our list)
-add ( After typing in this command, app will ask us for description -> time -> importance)
-remove ( After this command, we will be asked to type in index of task we want to delete)
-exit ( With this choice we exit our app & entered changes are saved into tasks.txt document)
